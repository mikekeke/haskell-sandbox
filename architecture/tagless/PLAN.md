# Plan

- [ ] Fix FIXMEs
- [ ] Make table and real requests for cargo reg service
- [ ] Copy ID web-service and add http impl for `IdService`
- [ ] Add readme
- [ ] Add `Makefile` for formatting and running (with nix shell check)
- [ ] Move one of repo implementations to separate packages to show source code independency (?)
